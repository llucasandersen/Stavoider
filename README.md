## 🎮 Game Description
**Stavoider** is a fun and challenging asteroid avoidance game originally created for my AP Computer Science Portfolio. In this game, you control a spaceship and try to avoid incoming asteroids while collecting green asteroids to destroy other asteroids. The game also includes a typing mini-game to add an extra layer of excitement.
